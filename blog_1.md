# Learning CUDA: From Fundamentals to Network Simulation

This blog series aims to make you learn GPUs working with the help of Cuda structurally, where you will be implementing the Watts-Strogatz small-world network model on GPUs at the end of the series.

### What you will learn
- GPUs working
- CUDA
- structuring algorithm into GPUs
