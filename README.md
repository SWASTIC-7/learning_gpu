## 🎯 Stage 1: Foundation - Understanding GPU Architecture

### Blog Post 1: "How GPUs Think Differently Than CPUs"

#### The Fundamental Difference

**CPUs are like a small team of experts** - few cores (4-16), each very smart, can do different tasks simultaneously (real multitasking).

**GPUs are like a massive factory floor** - thousands of simple workers (cores), all doing the same task on different data simultaneously (SIMT - Single Instruction Multiple Threads).

#### GPU Architecture Hierarchy

![layout](./assets/heiarchy.png)

Let's understand this from bottom-up:

##### 1. **Thread** - The Worker
- Smallest unit of execution
- Has its own **private registers** (fastest memory, ~100 cycles latency)
- Executes the same instruction as its warp-mates
- Example: Thread 0 processes array element 0, Thread 1 processes element 1, etc.

##### 2. **Warp** - The Squad (32 threads)
- **32 threads** always move together in lockstep
- All threads in a warp execute the **same instruction** at the same time
- **Critical concept**: If threads diverge (e.g., if-else), both paths execute sequentially = slower!
- Think: 32 workers on an assembly line, all doing the same step simultaneously

**Warp Divergence Example:**
```cuda
if (threadIdx.x % 2 == 0) {
    // Even threads execute this
} else {
    // Odd threads execute this  
}
// Within a warp, half threads are idle during each branch!
```

##### 3. **Thread Block** - The Department
- A 1D, 2D, or 3D array of threads (e.g., 256 threads = 8 warps)
- Max threads per block: typically **1024** (hardware dependent)
- Threads in a block can:
  - **Communicate** via **shared memory** (~300 cycles latency)
  - **Synchronize** using `__syncthreads()`
- Cannot communicate across blocks!

**Example block configurations:**
- `dim3 block(256)` → 1D block of 256 threads (8 warps)
- `dim3 block(16, 16)` → 2D block of 256 threads (good for matrices)
- `dim3 block(8, 8, 4)` → 3D block of 256 threads (for volumes)

##### 4. **Grid** - The Company
- A 1D, 2D, or 3D array of thread blocks
- Software concept defined by kernel launch: `kernel<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>()`
- Each block is assigned to a Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)
- Blocks execute independently (order not guaranteed!)

**Launch Configuration:**
```cuda
// Launch 10 blocks, each with 256 threads = 2,560 threads total
kernel<<<10, 256>>>(data);

// 2D grid: 16x16 blocks, each block has 16x16 threads
dim3 grid(16, 16);
dim3 block(16, 16);
matrixKernel<<<grid, block>>>(matrix);
```

##### 5. **Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)** - The Factory Floor
- Physical hardware unit containing CUDA cores
- Modern GPUs: 40-100+ SMs (e.g., RTX 3080 has 68 SMs)
- Each SM can run multiple blocks simultaneously
- Has its own:
  - Warp schedulers
  - Shared memory (48-96 KB per SM)
  - L1 cache
  - Register file

#### Memory Hierarchy: The Critical Performance Factor

![memory Hierarchy](./assets/memory_hiararchy.png)

**Speed vs Size Tradeoff:**

| Memory Type | Size | Latency | Scope | Use Case |
|------------|------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Registers** | ~64 KB/SM | 1 cycle | Per-thread | Loop counters, temp variables |
| **Shared Memory** | 48-96 KB/SM | ~30 cycles | Per-block | Inter-thread communication |
| **L1 Cache** | 16-128 KB/SM | ~30 cycles | Per-SM | Automatic caching |
| **L2 Cache** | 4-6 MB | ~200 cycles | GPU-wide | Automatic caching |
| **Global Memory** | 4-24 GB | ~400-800 cycles | GPU-wide | Main data storage |
| **CPU (Host) Memory** | 16-128 GB | ~100,000 cycles | CPU only | Data transfer via PCIe |

**The Golden Rule:** Minimize global memory accesses, maximize register/shared memory usage.

**Memory Transfer Pattern:**
```
CPU RAM ──cudaMemcpy──> GPU Global Memory ──kernel──> Process ──cudaMemcpy──> CPU RAM
   ↑                                                                              |
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Execution Model: SIMT (Single Instruction Multiple Threads)

**How a kernel executes:**

1. **Launch**: You call `kernel<<<grid, block>>>()` from CPU
2. **Distribution**: GPU runtime distributes blocks to available SMs
3. **Warp Execution**: SM's warp scheduler picks warps to execute
4. **Instruction Issue**: All 32 threads in a warp execute the same instruction
5. **Memory Latency Hiding**: While one warp waits for memory, scheduler runs another warp (zero-cost context switch!)

**Why GPUs are Fast:**
- **Throughput over latency**: Don't make one thing fast, do many things at once
- **Latency hiding**: Thousands of threads means always someone ready to work
- **Massive parallelism**: 10,000+ threads running simultaneously

**Example: Vector Addition**
```cuda
// CPU: Sequential (1 thread)
for (int i = 0; i < 1M; i++) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];  // 1 million iterations
}

// GPU: Parallel (1 million threads)
__global__ void vecAdd(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) c[i] = a[i] + b[i];  // 1 instruction × 1M threads!
}
```

#### Key Concepts Summary

**Thread Indexing (Most Important!):**
```cuda
// 1D indexing
int tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

// 2D indexing (for matrices)
int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

// Example: Block size 256, we're in block 3, thread 45
// tid = 3 * 256 + 45 = 813
```

**Synchronization:**
- `__syncthreads()`: Wait for all threads in a block (cannot sync across blocks!)
- `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`: CPU waits for GPU to finish

**Memory Access Patterns:**
- **Coalesced**: Consecutive threads access consecutive memory = fast!
- **Strided**: Threads access memory with gaps = slower
- **Random**: Threads access random locations = slowest

### Blog Post 3: "How to Represent Graphs for GPUs"

- Comparison with Erdős-Rényi random graphs

---

### Blog Post 4: "Generating Small-World Networks on the GPU"

**The Watts-Strogatz Model (1998):**

A landmark model that explains "six degrees of separation" - how networks can have both:
1. **High clustering** (your friends know each other)
2. **Short paths** (few hops to reach anyone)

**Algorithm:**
1. Start with ring lattice (high clustering, long paths)
2. Rewire each edge with probability `p` (creates shortcuts)
3. Result: Small-world for `p ≈ 0.01-0.1`

**Phase Transition:**
- `p = 0`: Regular lattice (ordered)
- `p = 0.01`: **Small-world** (sweet spot!)
- `p = 1`: Random graph (chaotic)

**File: `7_watts_strogatz.cu`**

Implements:
- Ring lattice construction (parallel per-node)
- Edge rewiring with cuRAND
- Conversion to CSR format
- Performance analysis

**Real-world applications:**
- Social networks (Facebook, Twitter)
- Brain connectivity (neural networks)
- Infrastructure (power grids, internet)
- Epidemic spreading models

---

### Blog Post 5: "Measuring Small-World Behavior on the GPU"

**Clustering Coefficient:**

Measures local structure: "What fraction of your friends are also friends with each other?"

**Formula:**
```
C_i = (triangles containing node i) / (possible triangles)
    = (actual friend-of-friend connections) / (maximum possible)
```

**Small-World Signature:**
```
C_watts_strogatz >> C_random  (much higher clustering)
L_watts_strogatz ≈ L_random   (similar short paths)
```

**File: `8_clustering_coefficient.cu`**

Demonstrates:
- Parallel computation of local clustering
- Triangle counting on GPU
- Parallel reduction for global average
- Performance comparison across different `p` values

**Experimental Results (N=1000, K=10):**
- `p = 0.0`: C ≈ 0.75 (regular lattice)
- `p = 0.01`: C ≈ 0.65 (small-world!)
- `p = 1.0`: C ≈ 0.01 (random)
